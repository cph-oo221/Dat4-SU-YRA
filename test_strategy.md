Primarily focus on acceptance tests, since the user experience is the most important part of the project.
Integration tests with tts libraty and different OS'es

# Test Environment
Local pc environment, with different users on different types of OS

# Testing Tools

# Release Control
- Git flow for version control, with finished releases of the project on main branch.
- CI with Github actions.

# Risk Analysis
People stealing software, maybe MIT license?
Vulnerable information in open source code, Github guardian?

# Review and Approvals
No releases without github unittests + integration tests
User acceptance test, to be used next releases
